<p> Well great, I suppose I am proficient enough about coding to give any semblance of describing Pseudocode decided by my instructors.</p>
<h3>What is Pseudocode?</h3>
    <p>Pseudocode is an abstract concept of decision making for logic that can be transferred into giving instructions for code. Because code is merely instructions to give to a machine</p>
    <p>Pseudocoding is important in programming because it gives a much-needed blueprint before you tackle writing the code. It is very easy to dive deep and not know where one is going.</p>
    <p>When one is very concise in every step you take in pseudocode or even a flowchart, that programmer takes his/her code that much farther with less time wasted on debugging.</p>
