<h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

<p>I had no expectations other than the fact I was going to get by a metaphorical freight train called 'bootcamp'</p>

<h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about??</h3>

<p>I like learning about the HTML/CSS/JS stuff but the syntax is a pain in the butt.</p>

<h3>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h3>

<p>Failure is allegedly my friend in this work environment</p>
