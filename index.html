<h2> Who am I?</h2>

<p> I was born in Lexington Kentucky and moved out to Wilmore, Kentucky, a small town outside of Nicholasville in 2019. 
  I graduated from Asbury University in 2019 with a Bachelor's in Media Communications specializing in TV Production. 
  Ironically, I started as a mathematics major.</p>

<h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

<p>I had no expectations going into other than the fact I was going to get by a metaphorical freight train called 'bootcamp'. 
  I didn't expect I would have to be in a hospital on my first couple days and that has become a major setback. So much information keeps getting shoved down my throat it is frustrating at every point.
After 4 days I can definitely say I have my work cut out for me.

<h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

<p>I like learning about the HTML/CSS/JS structuring and its rules but the syntax is a pain in the butt. Let alone how Github wants to work with file management.</p>

<h3>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h3>

<p>Failure is allegedly my friend in this work environment. I hope to be an inspiration but I have yet not much to prove at this point other than being stubborn</p>
