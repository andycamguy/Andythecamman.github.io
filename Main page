Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
-- I had no expectations other than the fact I was going to get by a metaphorical freight train called 'bootcamp'

What are you excited or eager to learn more about??

-- I like learning about the HTML/CSS/JS stuff but the syntax is a pain in the butt.


What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

-- Failure is allegedly my friend in this work environment
